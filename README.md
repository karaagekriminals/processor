# processor

IoT device processor, MIDI output generator, and customisation for the Low Heat instrument.

## Build Instructions

To "build" you must have:

- Python 3.6
- Pipenv

Install the Python dependencies with:

```
pipenv install
```

You probably want to be able to play a MIDI instrument using this. You can do this by setting up a virtual MIDI port. This is much easier on macOS through `Utilities->Audio Midi Setup->Window->Show MIDI Studio` than using LoopBe1.

That's it; after this, you can run the server!

## Information

- The midi2daw module was tested on Windows 10 with the LoopBe1 emulator and macOS High Sierra.

## API

To be completed.
